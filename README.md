# MNIST_DeepNeuralNetwork_numpy
When I started to make Deep learning(even though I'm still on my beginner's level...), I thought that Calculating front and backpropagation is really hard. And making deep neural network only using numpy helped me understand the specific structure behind Deep learning modules such as Tensorflow or Pytorch. I will try to make similar model only using C to boost my understandings later on.
